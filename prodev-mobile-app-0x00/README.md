ðŸ“¦ Expo Project Initialization Notes
While initializing the Expo project with:

sh
Copy
Edit
npx create-expo-app@latest .
I received the following warning:

The directory prodev-mobile-setup has files that might be overwritten:

This occurs because the current folder (prodev-mobile-setup) already contains files or subdirectories (e.g., mobile-development-setup). Expo CLI will not overwrite existing files without warning to prevent data loss.

Resolution / Best Practice:

It is recommended to create each Expo project in its own new, empty subdirectory.

Instead of running npx create-expo-app@latest . in a folder with existing files, use a unique folder name for each project:

sh
Copy
Edit
npx create-expo-app@latest prodev-mobile-app-0x00
This will create the new project inside prodev-mobile-setup/prodev-mobile-app-0x00 without risking accidental overwrites.

Takeaway:

Always start new Expo projects in their own clean folders.
This keeps each project organized and avoids file conflicts.
